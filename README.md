# Exploratory Analysis and Visualization of a Numerical Weather Prediction Model in the Alps

This project uses Python to perform an exploratory analysis of a dataset representing a numerical weather prediction model in a mountainous region of the Alps. Through data analysis and the creation of visualizations, weather trends in this region are identified and observed. The techniques used include:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identification of patterns and anomalies in the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Generation of interactive graphs and maps for better understanding of weather trends.

This project provides a solid foundation for understanding meteorological data and its behavior in mountainous environments.

## Repository Contents

1. **model.txt**
   - This file contains the dataset used in the project, representing a numerical weather prediction model in the Alps. The dataset is not formatted as a table, so it was formatted appropriately during the analysis process.

2. **Alps_Meteorological_Model_EDA.ipynb**
   - This Jupyter notebook performs the entire process of formatting, exploring, and analyzing the `model.txt` file. It includes techniques for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the creation of visualizations to identify and observe weather trends in the Alps region.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone this repository and open the `Alps_Meteorological_Model_EDA.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter. Ensure you have all the necessary Python libraries installed, which are typically listed in the notebook.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name 
```

## Requirements
Python 3.x  
Jupyter Notebook  
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn (additional libraries may be required as specified in the notebook)
