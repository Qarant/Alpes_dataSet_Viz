# Exploratory Analysis and Visualization of a Numerical Weather Prediction Model in the Alps

This project uses Python to perform an exploratory analysis of a dataset representing a numerical weather prediction model in a mountainous region of the Alps. Through data analysis and the creation of visualizations, weather trends in this region are identified and observed. The techniques used include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identification of patterns and anomalies in the dataset.
Data Visualization: Generation of interactive graphs and maps for better understanding of weather trends.
This project provides a solid foundation for understanding meteorological data and its behavior in mountainous environments.
